		<h3>Hi there!</h3>
		<p class="text-justify">			
			My name is Thiago, and I have been a <strong>Java middleware</strong> developer for about 7 years. I also enjoy learning and tinkering with different languages and technologies.
		</p>		
		<p class="text-justify">
			I'm based in Brazil and currently looking for interesting and challenging <strong>remote</strong> work opportunities anywhere in the world. Below you can find out more information about my current work and experience, and if you'd like to talk about job opportunities, programming, sim racing, books, guitar or computer games, my email is <strong><span class="email-text tooltip tooltip-bottom" data-tooltip="To avoid spam, please type in this email."/></strong>.

		<h3>Work Experience</h3>

		<h5>
			Developer at <a href="https://www.bb.com.br" target="_blank">Banco do Brasil</a> 
		</h5>
		<p class="label label-secondary">
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bras%C3%ADlia" target="_blank">Brasília</a> • Since 09/2012
		</p>
		<p class="text-justify">
			I'm the lead developer on the Java library that enables our applications to consume and provide services using a friendly API that abstracts away the complexities of communication between environments (mainframe, distributed and external). We've used <a href="https://netty.io" target="_blank">Netty</a> for the flexibility to use many different network transports and to ensure the library can provide the performance and latency requirements to support the heavy load of our mobile app, online banking, internal platforms and many other applications.
		</p>
		<p class="text-justify">
			 My latest work has been with a DevOps team where we used <a href="https://redis.io" target="_blank">Redis</a> to enable solutions that improve network resiliency, reduce response times and mainframe costs, such as:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Self-monitoring load balancing solution for requests coming into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CICS" target="_blank">CICS</a> middleware.</li>
			<li>Dynamic switching of network transport on a per-service and/or per-consumer basis.</li>
			<li>Service caching that can be enabled in real time in a transparent way to both the consumer and the provider.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h3>Skills and Technologies</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>Java (and related): Netty, CDI, JMS, TIBCO Rendezvous, Docker, Kafka, JCA and Oracle WebLogic.</li>
			<li>Used for small tools and side projects: Ruby, Go, Kotlin, JavaScript, NodeJS, React, Electron, Bash and Postgres.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Languages and Education</h3>
		<ul>	
			<li>I'm fluent in English and Brazilian Portuguese.</li>
			<li>I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from <a href="https://www.uniceub.br" target="_blank">UniCEUB</a>.</li>
		</ul>
